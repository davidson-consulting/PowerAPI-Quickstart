# PowerAPI Quickstart
*PowerAPI quickstart* is a collection of opinionated scripts and configuration files that allows developers and researchers to easily start a PowerAPI monitoring stack.

The deployed stack is composed of several components:
- One or several *PowerAPI sensors*, used to collect metrics exposed by the processor
- A *Mongo* database, used to store metrics collected by the *sensor(s)*
- A *PowerAPI formula*, used to compute the energy consumption of the monitored processes
- A *InfluxDB* database, used to store values generated by the formula
- A *Grafana* dashboard, to display the generated values in real-time.

In addition we provide simple scripts to gather the generated metrics.

You can find more about PowerAPI in [its documentation](http://powerapi.org/).

## Prerequisites
Hardware requirements: Servers that will host PowerAPI sensors must have a Sandy Bridge Intel processor (or newer).

Software requirements: see the `README.md` file under each deployment folder.

## Usage

This project provide several ways to deploy PowerAPI, under the `deployment` folder. If you want to:
- Deploy PowerAPI on a **single** server, see the `docker-compose` directory
- Deploy PowerAPI on a **cluster**, see the `docker-stack` directory

Once the PowerAPI stack deployed, you can start programs you want to monitor in a Docker container.
